# LichessBot
funny bot for lichess.com

This bot is made with the aim of entertainment and enjoyment.

First launch flask server -> satranc_server.py<br>
Second, download tampermonkey plugin (in my experience it works fine for chrome)<br>
Third, copy the code from satranc_bot.js and open a new script in tampermonkey and paste it in<br>
Alternative way for the third step, open tampermonkey and enter the "Utilities" section, enter the "Import from file" section and import the txt file in the repo.
