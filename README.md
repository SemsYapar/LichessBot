# LichessBot
funny bot for lichess.com

This bot is made with the aim of entertainment and enjoyment.

First launch flask server -> satranc_server.py\n
Second, download tampermonkey plugin (in my experience it works fine for chrome)\n
Third, copy the code from satranc_bot.js and open a new script in tampermonkey and paste it in\n
Alternative way for the third step, open tampermonkey and enter the "Utilities" section, enter the "Import from file" section and import the txt file in the repo.
